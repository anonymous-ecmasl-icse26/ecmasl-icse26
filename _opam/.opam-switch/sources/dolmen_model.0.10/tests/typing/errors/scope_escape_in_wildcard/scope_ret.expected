Error The typechecker inferred the type for the quantified variable `f` to be
      `int -> a`.
      That inference lead to infer that type to contain the variable `a`
      which is not in the scope of the inferred type.
      Variable `f` was bound at line 2, character 12-13
      Variable `a` was bound at line 3, character 7-16.
