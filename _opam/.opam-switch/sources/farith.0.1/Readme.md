# Farith2

Farith2 is an *under construction* Coq module formalizing floating points abstract domains based on [Flocq](http://flocq.gforge.inria.fr/).

## Structure

The structure of the sources may vary a lot over time. For now the structure is as follows :

+ the folder `thry` contains all Coq modules
+ the folder `farith_big` contains OCaml modules used to provide a compatibility layer with Zarith for efficient extraction
+ the `extract.v` file drives the extraction to OCaml
+ the root contains `.ml(i)` files generated by extraction

## Compilation

The compilation of the Coq sources is handled with CoqMakefile. To compile everything, simply type `make` at Farith2's root.

To generate the documentation, it is first required to build the sources using `make` and then `make doc` should fill the `doc` folder with the html documentation formatted using [coq2html](https://github.com/xavierleroy/coq2html).
