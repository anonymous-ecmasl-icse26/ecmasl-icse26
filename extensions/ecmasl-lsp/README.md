# A New Language Server for the ECMAScript Specification Language

This project involves the development of a language server for ECMA-SL, a formal specification language used to create executable specifications for ECMAScript. The primary goal was to improve editor support for ECMA-SL by providing features such as syntax highlighting, error diagnostics, go-to-definition, and code completion.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting:** Improves code readability by visually distinguishing language constructs.
- **Error Diagnostics:** Identifies and reports errors in the code in real time.
- **Go-to-Definition:** Allows quick navigation to the definition of variables and functions.
- **Hover:** Displays detailed type information and function signatures when hovering over variables or functions.
- **Code Completion:** Suggests keywords, functions, and parameters while typing.
